# DremJS
A web OS featuring 3rd party support, an IDE (coming soon!), and much more (coming soon too :v).

It's free and completly hosted on GitHub. No more building needed!!!
Just download this and upload it to your own web server (as this project is open source and licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3). Just give credit for the original source code.

No need for JQuery!!! JQuery is already embedded in DremJS. Applications that hardcode a location for JQuery should be changed to 'jquery/<the jquery version it uses'.

Alternatively, you can fork this repository and go to the following site after setting up GitHub pages:
<code>yourusername.github.io/DremJS</code>
However, this is depreciated as updating and installing apps is much harder.

## How to manualy update your DremJS Desktop
Updating the DremJS Desktop is quite easy, as long as you know what you're doing.
### Step 1
Go into the index-open.html file and copy your application list to clipbord or to a txt file.

### Step 2
Download the repository and unzip the zip file to your DremJS Desktop. Overwrite all files.

### Step 3
Copy your DremJS Desktop application list with the new application list in the new index-open.html file.

Note: You should delete any duplicate application listings!

And that's it! Now you have the latest version of DremJS installed on your web server!
