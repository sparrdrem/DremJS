# DremJS
A web OS featuring 3rd party support, an IDE (coming soon!), and much more (coming soon too :v).

It's free and completly hosted on GitHub. No more building needed!!! Just fork the DremJS Repository and go to:

<code>yourusername.github.io/DremJS</code>

Alternatively, you can also download this and upload it to your own web server (as this project is open source). Just give credit for the original source code.
